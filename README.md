The project required implementing a motion planning stack for an autonomous vehicle capable of lane tracking, avoiding static and dynamic obstacles, and handling stop signs. The system was designed to include *behavioral planning*, *path generation*, *collision checking*, *path selection*, and *velocity profile generation*. The behavioral planner manages transitions between driving states using a finite state machine. Path generation computes optimized spiral paths, while collision checking ensures obstacle-free navigation. Path selection prioritizes safe and efficient routes, and velocity planning generates smooth, feasible speed profiles. The implemented solution meets all expectations, demonstrating correct vehicle behavior in simulation.
